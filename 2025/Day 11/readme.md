# Day 11: Reactor

## Part 1

**Narrative:** You discover a toroidal reactor in a factory basement that needs to communicate with a newly installed server rack. The Elves provide a list of devices and their output connections, and suspect a malfunction is caused by data following a specific path through the system.

**Task:** Find *every* path from `you` to `out` and count them.

## Example Problem

Given a device network where data flows from one device to its outputs, determine how many unique paths exist from the starting device (labeled "you") to the final output (labeled "out"). The example demonstrates 5 different paths through the provided device configuration.
