# Day 4: Printing Department

## Story Context

You're in the printing department of the North Pole base. The elves need help optimizing forklift work to clear time for breaking through a wall to access the cafeteria beyond.

## Part 1: The Challenge

The puzzle involves a grid containing paper rolls marked with `@` symbols. The core requirement is:

"The forklifts can only access a roll of paper if there are *fewer than four rolls of paper* in the eight adjacent positions."

**Your Task:** Count how many rolls of paper can be accessed by a forklift based on this rule - specifically, those with fewer than 4 rolls in their 8 adjacent neighboring positions.

The example shows a 10x10 grid where 13 rolls meet this accessibility criterion (marked with `x`).

## Part 2

Part 2 likely extends this with additional constraints or a different counting requirement.
