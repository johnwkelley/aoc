# Day 9: Movie Theater

## Narrative

The protagonist arrives at the North Pole base movie theater, which features a decorative tile floor. Elves are redecorating by repositioning red tiles within a grid pattern. A list of red tile coordinates is provided as input.

## Part 1

**Objective:** Find the largest rectangle possible using two red tiles as opposite corners.

**Requirements:**
- Two red tiles serve as opposite corners of a rectangle
- The goal is to maximize the rectangle's area
- The example demonstrates that among various possible rectangles (areas of 24, 35, 6, and 50), the maximum achievable area is **50**

The puzzle essentially asks: given a set of red tile coordinates, calculate the area of the largest axis-aligned rectangle that can be formed by selecting any two coordinates as diagonally opposite corners.
