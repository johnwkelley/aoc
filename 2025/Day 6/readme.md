# Day 6: Trash Compactor

## Story

You've fallen into a garbage smasher with a magnetically sealed door. While waiting for cephalopods to help you escape, you're asked to assist with math homework.

## Part 1

The puzzle involves a math worksheet with problems arranged horizontally in a compact layout.

**Format:** Numbers are arranged vertically in columns, with an operation symbol (`+` or `*`) at the bottom of each problem. Problems are separated by blank columns.

## Example

- Problem 1: "123 * 45 * 6 = 33210"
- Problem 2: "328 + 64 + 98 = 490"
- Problem 3: "51 * 387 * 215 = 4243455"
- Problem 4: "64 + 23 + 314 = 401"

**Task:** Calculate each problem's result using its specified operation, then sum all results to find the "grand total" (33210 + 490 + 4243455 + 401 = 4277556 in the example).

**Your Goal:** Solve the problems on the math worksheet. What is the grand total found by adding together all of the answers to the individual problems?
