# Day 7: Laboratories

## Story Narrative

After escaping the trash compactor with cephalopod assistance, you find yourself in a North Pole research wing focused on teleportation technology. You step onto a yellow teleporter pad and suddenly materialize in an unfamiliar room with no doors. A diagnostic tool displays error code `0H-N0`, indicating a problem with a tachyon manifold that needs repair.

## Part 1: Counting Beam Splits

**Problem Setup:**
A tachyon beam enters a manifold diagram at location `S` and moves downward through empty space (marked with `.`). When the beam encounters a splitter (`^`), it stops and instead creates two new beams: one continuing left and one continuing right from the splitter.

**Task:** Analyze your manifold diagram. *How many times will the beam be split?*

The example provided shows a 15x16 grid where tracking all beam splits through multiple levels of splitters results in **21 total splits**.
